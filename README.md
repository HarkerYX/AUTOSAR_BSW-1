# AUTOSAR_LIB

### INTRODUCTION
The main purpose of this project is to implement CLASSIC AUTOSAR BSW STACK.

### WORKING TARGET NOW
#### CAN communication stack
1. CanIf (WORKING)

### HOW TO USE
1. After implementing the CAN communication stack, I will verify it on a development board.
2. Currently unavailable to run.

### FUTURE
In addition to AUTOSAR OS, I hope that several commonly used BSW modules can be implemented according to the standards 
as much as possible. It is expected that CAN, LIN and ETH communication and diagnosis can be implemented on a development 
board in the future. It also includes NVM-related modules.
